    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Veg Hakka noodles are a popular Indo-Chinese dish that has gained immense popularity in India and beyond, appealing to a wide range of taste preferences. This savory dish consists of stir-fried noodles that are tossed with a variety of vegetables such as bell peppers, onions, cabbage, and carrots, making it vibrant and nutritious. The noodles used are typically made from wheat and are of the Hakka or egg variety, which are known for their firm and slightly chewy texture. The vegetables are sautéed at a high temperature to retain their crunch, adding a delightful contrast to the soft noodles.</p>
    <p>The flavor of Veg Hakka noodles is distinctively characterized by the use of soy sauce, vinegar, and sometimes chili sauce, which imparts a tangy, umami-rich taste that is both bold and balanced. Garlic and ginger are often added to the stir-fry, lending an aromatic depth that enhances the overall flavor profile of the dish. It is commonly garnished with spring onions and served hot, making it a comforting yet light meal. Veg Hakka noodles embody the fusion of Chinese cooking techniques with Indian flavors, resulting in a dish that is both familiar and novel, and can be enjoyed as a main course or a side dish.</p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil the Hakka noodles in water with a little salt until they are just cooked (al dente). Drain and rinse under cold water to stop the cooking process. Toss them with a teaspoon of oil to prevent sticking.</li>

        <li>Add the sliced onions and sauté for a minute until they start to soften.</li>
        <li>Introduce the sliced bell peppers, carrots, and shredded cabbage to the pan. Stir-fry the vegetables on high heat for 2-3 minutes, ensuring they retain some crunch.</li>
        <li>Push the vegetables to one side of the pan and add the boiled noodles to the other side. Pour the soy sauce, vinegar, and optional chili sauce over the noodles.</li>
        <li>Mix everything thoroughly in the pan, ensuring the noodles and vegetables are well combined and evenly coated with the sauces. Season with salt (if needed) and pepper.</li>
        <li>Stir-fry the mixture for an additional 2-3 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat and drizzle sesame oil (if using) over the noodles for added flavor. Give it a final mix.</li>
        <li>Garnish with chopped spring onions before serving the Veg Hakka noodles hot.</li>
