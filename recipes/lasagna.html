    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A veggie lasagna is a delightful twist on the classic Italian dish, layered with a colorful array of roasted or sautéed vegetables, such as zucchini, bell peppers, mushrooms, spinach, and eggplant, nestled between tender sheets of pasta. Each layer is generously interspersed with rich tomato sauce, infused with herbs like basil and oregano, adding depth and tanginess to the dish. The use of ricotta cheese, or a vegan alternative, adds creaminess, while a top layer of melted mozzarella or vegan cheese provides a golden, bubbly crust that is both visually appealing and deliciously inviting.</p>

    <p>This version of lasagna not only celebrates the bounty of the garden in its variety and freshness but also offers a lighter, more nutritious alternative to its meat-based counterpart without sacrificing flavor or satisfaction. The interplay of textures from the soft vegetables, smooth cheese, and al dente pasta, alongside the complexity of flavors from the savory vegetables, sweet tomato sauce, and aromatic herbs, makes veggie lasagna a comforting yet sophisticated dish that delights the palate and nourishes the body.</p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prep the Vegetables: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Thinly slice or chop the zucchini, bell peppers, mushrooms, and eggplant. Mince the garlic and finely chop the onion.</li>

        <li>Sauté Vegetables: In a large skillet over medium heat, add olive oil. Once hot, add the garlic and onion, sautéing until translucent. Add the rest of the vegetables in batches, starting with the ones that take the longest to cook like eggplant and bell peppers, followed by zucchini and mushrooms. Cook until they're all tender. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Stir in the spinach at the end, allowing it to wilt. Remove from heat.</li>

        <li>Prepare the Tomato Sauce: In a separate pot, combine the tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, and tomato paste. Bring to a simmer, adding chopped basil, oregano, salt, and pepper to taste. Let simmer for about 10-15 minutes to meld the flavors.</li>

        <li>Cook Lasagna Noodles: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the lasagna noodles according to package instructions until al dente. Drain and lay the noodles flat on a clean towel to prevent sticking.</li>

        <li>Mix Cheeses: In a bowl, combine ricotta cheese with a pinch of salt and pepper. If using, stir in grated Parmesan cheese. You can also add a bit of chopped basil for extra flavor.</li>

        <li>Assemble the Lasagna: In a deep baking dish, spread a layer of tomato sauce on the bottom. Place a layer of lasagna noodles over the sauce. Spread a layer of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by a layer of sautéed vegetables. Sprinkle a layer of shredded mozzarella cheese over the top. Repeat the layering process (sauce, noodles, ricotta, vegetables, mozzarella) until all ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of noodles topped with sauce and a generous amount of mozzarella cheese.</li>

        <li>Bake: Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for about 25 minutes. Remove the foil and continue to bake for another 10-15 minutes, or until the top is golden and bubbly.</li>

        <li>Cool and Serve: Let the lasagna stand for about 10 minutes after removing it from the oven. This rest period helps the lasagna set and makes it easier to cut. Garnish with fresh basil leaves before serving.</li>
