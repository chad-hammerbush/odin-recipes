    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Vada Pav is a popular Indian street food that originated in the state of Maharashtra. It consists of a deep-fried potato dumpling (vada) placed inside a bread bun (pav) sliced almost in half through the middle. The potato filling is typically spiced with a mixture of garlic, ginger, turmeric, and mustard seeds, creating a flavorful snack. The vada is also often coated in a gram flour batter before being fried, which adds a satisfying crunch to the softness of the potato and bread.</p>
    <p>This simple yet delicious dish is usually served with one or more chutneys, such as a green chutney made from coriander and mint, and a tangy tamarind chutney. Additionally, a sprinkling of garlic and chili powder is often added for an extra kick. Vada Pav is not just a quick snack; it's a cultural icon in Mumbai and other parts of Maharashtra, embodying the bustling street food scene and enjoyed by people from all walks of life.</p>
